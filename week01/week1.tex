		\question
		(Filipov 79) A large chamber contains 200 cubic meters of gas, 0.15\% of which is carbon dioxide (CO2). A ventilator exchanges 20 cubic meters per minute of this gas with new gas containing only 0.04\% CO2. Write down a differential equation that describes the change of the concentration of CO2.
		 
		\textcolor{cyan}{Answer:} $y' = 0.008 - 0.1y$.
		 
		\question
		(Filipov 83) A raft is being slowed down by resistance of the water, the resistance being proportional to the speed of the raft. Write down a differential equation that describes how the speed of the boat changes in time.
		
		\textcolor{cyan}{Answer:} $v' = -kv$.
		
		\question
		(Filipov 85) It is experimentally determined that every gram of radium loses 0.44 milligrams in 1 year. Write down a differential equation that describes how the mass of the radium changes in time.
		
		\textcolor{cyan}{Answer:} $m' = -km$.
		
		\question
		(Filipov 98) A boat is held by a cable that is wound around a post, the end being held by a laborer. Write down a differential equation that defines how braking force changes with the number of wounds around the post. The coefficient of friction is $\frac{1}{3}$.
		
		\textcolor{cyan}{Answer:} $\frac{dT}{d\theta} = \frac{T}{3}$.
		
		\question
		(Filipov 100) The mass of a rocket, including a full chamber of fuel, is $M$; its net mass (without fuel) is $m$. The products of combustion are ejected with velocity $c$. If the rocket starts from rest, find Ciolkovskiiâ€™s formula, which gives the speed imparted to the rocket by the burning of the fuel, neglecting the resistance of the atmosphere.
		
		\textcolor{cyan}{Answer:} $-m \frac{dV}{dt} = c \frac{dm}{dt}$.
